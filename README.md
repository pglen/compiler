# Compiler studies

## Wouldn't it be nice to ....
 .... have a compiler that can do pre-processiong,
high level, medium level and low level code at the same time?

 * That can do system code, app code, driver code in one go.
 * That helps you code instead of forcing you to tinker wih codeing tools?
 * That is simple?
 * That is safe?
 * That can reuse previous code, objects, libraries?
 * That can get injection from high / medium / low / ASM level extensions
